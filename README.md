# OSOS
<h1>Main Base Operating System Code Project</h1>
<h1>Hi this is OSOS Open Source Operating System</h1>! 
please email the idea founder at ajarnspencer@gmail.com for any inquiries or requests to join the project!</h3>
<h4>OSOS Intends to be what Linux was supposed to become (and is, in as far as what it was intended for), but should develop free open source software that covers all the needs of most content creators (Visual, Audible, Tactile), professional musicians and prrogrammers, developers and graphic artists, as well as for content consumption to cover all types of content ranging from cbr comic file readers, to universally file compatible video players, and other such forms of media consumption and creation tools such as word processors and office apps. Social Networking sites such as Facebook will be a channelnge to open up access to such an OS, and so we intend to follow Huawei's Idea, as seen with their own appstore workaround apps, and make our own Facebook and Twitter and Youtube viewing apps that only allow the essential content to be accessed, but no information about the OS or the devicce being used will be revealed. This kind of inbuilt app suite is our most challenging quest, due to the massive BIG DATA collection implemented by such mega social platform domains, and the scripts they try to execute in our browsers.
  
Other projects, which will relate to the development of compatible technologies. and rendering of such emerging Informaton Technology advancements, in both hardware and software, and the imagined applied uses and implementations, which should be compatable with the OSOS Open Source Operating System, can be studied on my websites at https://obmlabs.com and https://hoload.co (and more related tech sites to come). The OSOS Project includes a secure open source chat branch project to bge incorporated into the OS as one of the first generic inbuilt apps, that we hope to prevent any kind of monitoring at all by third parties, or intercepted by hackers, bots, or anonymous listeners-in, using modern evasive ntechnologies and genial code, along with A.I. algorithms to prevent any intruders.
